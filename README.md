# ffmpeg-interactive
A simple and very niche wrapper around ffmpeg for mp4 cutting and trimming.
## Installation
1. Download a pre-built exe from [releases](https://github.com/BoOmka/ffmpeg-interactive/releases) (or build it yourself (or don't build at all and just use it as python script)).
2. Install [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/) and add its location to your PATH env variable: [tutorial](https://helpdeskgeek.com/windows-10/add-windows-path-environment-variable/)
3. Run as follows:
  ```cmd
  ffmpeg-interactive C:\Videos\my-example-video.mp4
  ```
4. To get help:
  ```cmd
  ffmpeg-interactive --help
  ```
